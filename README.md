Hi

This is the repository for the Interface Specification Language (ISL)

ISL is in and of itself simply a format for writing specifications for a project. There us a little bit of structure, but it differs from things like qucumber because it won't be parsed by a computer, just by AI.

In this repository, you will also find tools that help you to quickly create and intetact with the specifications for a project.
