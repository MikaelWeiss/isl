Here is the plan for the progression of the project.

1. Define the specification format
2. Create a simple CLI where you can have some interactions between the specs and your code
- Have the ability to turn Claude Code conversations into specs
- Have the ability to turn exported Claude or ChatGPT conversations into specs
- Be able to take any spec and turn it into a prompt that is optimized for the coding
3. Create a GUI for that interaction
